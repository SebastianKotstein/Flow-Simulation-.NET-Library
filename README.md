# Flow-Simulation-.NET-Library
A C# .NET library for designing, simulating and analyzing material flows in intralogistics

This software library provides a toolkit for designing, simulating and analyzing material flows in intralogistics using an object-oriented programming model. By relying on an object-oriented approach, this library aims to ensure that even complex simulations can be modelled descriptively and realistically with an easily readable code. Complex and pure mathematical models as they are often used in domain-specific languages (DSL) for flow simulations can be avoided by using this approach.
